# Air Canvas
Air Canvas is a hands-free digital drawing canvas that utilizes a Raspberry Pi, a PiCamera, and OpenCV to recognize and map hand gestures onto a PiTFT screen. The user’s “brush” can be modified in size and color by using built-in buttons. The direction of the brush is controlled completely using open source OpenCV software and modified to map the pointer finger onto the screen using Pygame following a calibration screen to measure and record the color of the user’s hand. The idea for Air Canvas was a result of our interest in digital drawing and smart photo recognition software.
