      <h1 >Objective</h1>

      
      <p>To create a simple prototype for a drawing tool that uses hand gesture recognition software to paint on a PiTFT screen. Core objectives include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using OpenCV to recognize the pointer finger.</li>
        <li>Mapping coordinates extracted from hand recognition software to PyGame to produce a drawing. 
</li>
        <li>Implementing additional features such as color change, size change, and both on-screen and physical buttons.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Air Canvas is a hands-free digital drawing canvas that utilizes a Raspberry Pi, a PiCamera, and OpenCV to recognize and map hand gestures onto a PiTFT screen. The user’s “brush” can be modified in size and color by using built-in buttons. The direction of the brush is controlled completely using open source OpenCV software and modified to map the pointer finger onto the screen using Pygame following a calibration screen to measure and record the color of the user’s hand. The idea for Air Canvas was a result of our interest in digital drawing and smart photo recognition software.
